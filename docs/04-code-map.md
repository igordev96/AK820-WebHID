# 04 · Code map

The app is a Vite, React and TypeScript project. `index.html` is only the Vite entry; the code
lives in `src/`. The keymap, HID and editor modules under `src/lib` import no React, so the same
code runs in the browser and under Vitest.

## 1. Layout

## 2. Boundaries

`src/lib/keymap` and `src/lib/hid` are framework-free. They export functions and types; they do
not import React or touch the DOM except through the `WebHidDevice` shape the caller supplies.
`src/lib/editor` is also React-free: plain state, a reducer and storage.

React components render and dispatch. They never call `navigator.hid`. `useDevice` owns the
chooser, open and close, and the disconnect listener. Uploads go through `TransferService`. The
advanced drawer calls the probe services. Both receive a transport, and writes happen only in
event handlers.

## 3. Transport

`src/lib/hid/protocol.ts` holds the fixed values:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VENDOR_ID` | `0x0C45` | AJAZZ vendor id |
| `PRODUCT_IDS` | `0x8009`, `0x800A`, `0xFDFD` | accepted product ids |
| `CONFIG_USAGE_PAGE` / `CONFIG_USAGE` | `0xFF13` / `0x0001` | the configuration collection |
| `REPORT_ID` / `REPORT_SIZE` | `0` / `64` | feature report framing |
| `CHUNK_SIZE` / `CHUNK_COUNT` | `64` / `9` | 576 bytes in 9 chunks |
| `TIMING.settle` / `TIMING.poll` | `220` / `60` ms | reply wait and poll interval |

`HidClient.send` pads one payload to 64 bytes and calls `sendFeatureReport(0, frame)`.
`HidClient.read` races `receiveFeatureReport(0)` against a clock timeout and returns
`{ ok: true, bytes }` or `{ ok: false, reason }`.

`TransferService.sendTable` is the app's key-table write path:

```text
04 18  →  04 11 (top) or 04 27 (Fn)  →  9 x 64-byte chunks  →  04 02  →  04 F0
```

`waitReply` settles for 220 ms, then polls every 60 ms for up to 6 s. It accepts only a frame
where byte 1 matches the command and byte 3 is not zero. A commit `0xFF` is a firmware rejection,
not a transport failure; `isTransportFailed` keeps the two apart.

`TransferService.sendTime` uses the same staged shape for the screen clock:

```text
04 18  →  04 28 (byte 8 = 1)  →  one 64-byte body  →  04 02
```

There is no `04 F0` after the commit, which matches the vendor app. `src/lib/hid/time.ts` builds
the body; the layout is in `docs/01-protocol.md` §9.

`TransferService.sendAnimation` writes the screen. Begin and announce (`04 72`, mode 3, block
count) go over the feature transport, the 4096-byte blocks go over a separate `OutputTransport`
bound to the `0xFF68` device, then the commit. Blocks are paced 150 ms apart, which matches the
vendor's 153 ms. `src/lib/screen` builds the buffer; the layout is in `docs/01-protocol.md` §10.

`TransferService.sendLighting` writes one 64-byte record with the staged runner: `04 18`, `04 13`
with one chunk, the record, a 60 ms pause, `04 02`, `04 F0`. `src/lib/lighting` builds the record;
the layout is in `docs/01-protocol.md` §11.

`TransferService` owns the transfer lock. A second `sendTable` or `sendTime` call returns
`{ busy: true }` instead of interleaving. `App` also keeps one busy flag for uploads, clock writes
and advanced probes, so a probe cannot run during an upload and an upload cannot start during a
probe.

## 4. Keymap

```text
FACTORY_KEYS           81 entries: idx, usage, name, x, y, w, h
modBit                 0xE0..0xE7 -> 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
encodeRecord           keyboard -> [0x02, mod, usage, 0]
                       consumer -> [0x03, lo, hi, 0]
buildTable             576 zeroed bytes, record at idx * 4,
                       skips usage 0 and fnlayer_disable on the Fn layer,
                       writes AA 55 at bytes 574..575
parseUsageToken        "0x04" keyboard, "c:0xE2" consumer
parseMapText           "idx [c:]usage name" per line, # comments
```

`usageLabel` (keymap names) prints a human label and carries the `media` flag, so a value is never
shown without its page. `usageToken` (editor state) prints the raw token, with `c:` for media.

## 5. Editor state

```text
EditorState    { top, fn, layer, selected }
EditorRow      { idx, usage, media, name, x, y, w, h,
                 factory, factoryMedia, applied, appliedMedia }
```

Every row carries what the editor says now (`usage`, `media`), what is believed to be on the
keyboard (`applied`, `appliedMedia`), and the baseline (`factory`, `factoryMedia`). On the Fn layer
the factory baseline is zero, because zero means "firmware default".

`getPendingCount` counts rows where `usage !== applied || media !== appliedMedia`. The page matters
too: `0xE2` Left Alt to `0xE2` Mute changes only `media`.

Reducer actions:

```text
select              select a key index on the active layer
layer               switch layer, clear the selection
usage               set usage and media on the selected row, after validation
reset-selected      return the selected row to its factory value
restore-layer       return every row on the active layer to factory
uploaded            copy usage/media into applied/appliedMedia
replace             swap in a whole state (restore confirmation)
```

`applied` moves only on `uploaded`, which `App` dispatches after a `commit 0x01`. `saveFnOverrides`
runs in the same success branch. `src/lib/editor/persistence.ts` stores Fn rows as
`[idx, usage]` or `[idx, usage, 1]` for media under `ak820.fn.overrides`.

## 6. UI

The board is data-driven from `FACTORY_KEYS`. Each key is an absolutely positioned button at
`x/y/w/h` on a 624 × 250 canvas. A `ResizeObserver` scales the canvas between 0.6× and 1.45× to fit
its container. Keys are not re-laid out on mobile; the whole board scales.

Visual states are separate: brass edge and brass legend mean "differs from factory", a brass dot
means "not uploaded", an ivory edge means "selected", and a dashed cap means "firmware-owned on the
Fn layer". Brass is never used as decoration, because the legend gives it meaning.

The inspector mirrors the board and is the only place that edits a usage. The layer tabs switch
between `top` and `fn`. The pending bar stages the upload, and the restore confirmation lives
beside it. The log drawer keeps every transport line.

`ViewTabs` switches the workbench between the board and the screen. The screen view keeps the same
two-column grid: the 128 × 128 preview takes the board's place, and `ClockCard` takes the
inspector's. The card owns the Now/Custom choice, the live clock and the send status. A clock write
is never started by connecting or by switching views; it needs the **Send time** button.

`AnimationCard` sits under the clock card. It decodes a GIF with the browser's `ImageDecoder`
(`src/lib/screen/decode.ts`), composites each frame to 128 × 128, converts it to RGB565 and keeps
the delays. The file never leaves the page. Uploads show block progress; there is no cancel,
because the firmware cannot abort a stream it has started. The card is disabled when WebHID did not
return the `0xFF68` interface.

`LightingPanel` shows the 20 effects. Each mode's controls come from the vendor database:
colour and Colourful, brightness, speed, and the direction pair for its axis. The controls are
shadcn-style Radix primitives, so tabs own their panels, sliders expose their values and the
select is keyboard-driven. `LightPreview` is the real 81-key board; it animates an approximation
of the selected effect from the mode, speed, direction, brightness and Colourful state, and stops
under `prefers-reduced-motion`. The mode-to-motion table and each key's position in the wave live
in `src/lib/lighting/preview.ts`, so the travel direction of a row or column and the rotation
flip are tested without a keyboard. Effects that react to a key press are not modelled: the panel
has no keystroke to react to. After a confirmed commit, `src/lib/lighting/describe.ts` writes the
confirmation and the log line from the mode's own flags, so a mode without a speed control never
reports one, and a mode that cycles through colours never promises the picker's hex.

`AdvancedDrawer` holds four tabs: diagnostics, deep probe, mailbox and raw command. It takes a
`clock` prop, which is the real clock in the app and a fake clock in tests. Probes report through
the same log and set the app busy flag through `onBusyChange`.

The suite needs no keyboard. `src/test/hidFakes.ts` provides `FakeClock` and `FakeTransport`, and
the app tests install a fake `navigator.hid`.

`src/lib/screen/decode.ts` needs the browser's `ImageDecoder`, so it has no jsdom test; Test 12
exercises it on the board.

`npm run verify` runs the typecheck, the linter, the format check, Vitest and the production build.
All five must pass before a commit.

`src/App.tsx` loads the screen panel, the lighting panel and the advanced drawer with
`React.lazy`, so the first visit downloads the key editor alone: about 108 kB gzipped instead of
166 kB. The drawer chunk is warmed when a keyboard connects, because it cannot open before that.
A lazy panel shows a short `Loading the … panel` placeholder while its chunk arrives, which is why
the app tests wait with `findBy` after switching views.

## 8. Invariants

1. **One transfer at a time.** `TransferService` owns the lock; the app busy flag serializes probes
   against uploads.
2. **Never stage after a bad begin or announce.** Send `04 F0` and stop.
3. **Poll for a stamped reply.** Never replace `waitReply` with one read.
4. **The table is always 576 bytes.** Records at `idx * 4`, trailer `AA 55`, `idx ≤ 142`.
5. **Fn layer: zero means firmware default.** Never seed it with `FACTORY_KEYS`.
6. **`fnlayer_disable` keys are read-only on the Fn layer.** Refuse the edit and disable the key.
7. **`applied` and `appliedMedia` move only on `commit 0x01`.**
8. **Persist only after success.** `saveFnOverrides` runs inside the accepted branch.
9. **The record page is explicit.** `media` selects `0x03`; never infer it from the usage number.
   The raw token for media is `c:0x…`.
10. **No HID writes in render or `useEffect`.** StrictMode double-invokes effects, and a double
    upload is a hardware failure.
11. **The screen clock shares the transfer lock.** It stages one 64-byte chunk, commits, and sends
    no end command. It never touches the key table, and it is never written on connect.
12. **Screen pixels use their own interface.** The 4096-byte output reports go to the `0xFF68`
    device; the `0xFF13` feature transport only carries begin, announce and commit.
13. **The animation block count is 16 bits.** `announce[8]` is the low byte and `announce[9]` the
    high byte. Truncating it makes the firmware expect a shorter upload, accept the frames anyway
    and reject the commit, which leaves a mix of old and new frames on the screen.
14. **An animation upload is never interrupted.** Once the announce is accepted, the firmware
    expects every block. `04 F0` does not abort it, the keyboard stops responding until replug, and
    the frames already written stay. No cancel button, no signal, no timeout.
15. **The light is one 64-byte record with `AA 55` at offset 14.** Byte 8 is colourful, 9 brightness,
    10 speed and 11 direction (0 right, 1 left, 2 up, 3 down). Announce `04 13` with one chunk, then
    commit and end. Leave 60 ms before the commit.

## 9. Common changes

To add a usage or a media function, edit `USAGE_NAMES`, `USAGE_GROUPS` and `MEDIA_NAMES` in
`src/lib/keymap/names.ts`. The picker and the labels follow.

To accept another product id, add it to `PRODUCT_IDS` in `src/lib/hid/protocol.ts`. The WebHID
filters are built from that list.

To change the board, edit `FACTORY_KEYS` and then `docs/key-index-table.md`. The geometry is baked
into those numbers; the vendor XML is not distributed.

To add a record type, change `encodeRecord`, widen `validateUsage`, extend the token parser if the
value no longer fits its page, and add byte tests.

Only two layers exist on this board, `0x11` and `0x27`. A third needs new evidence from the
firmware.

## 10. The v1 code

The single-file v1 app and its Node harnesses are at tag `v1.0.1`. Nothing in the v2 test path
reads `index.html`; the npm scripts are the only check path.
